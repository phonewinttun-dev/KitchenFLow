# POS + KDS Project Features

This document outlines the core features of the Point of Sale (POS) and Kitchen Display System (KDS) application. The system focuses on a streamlined, automated workflow between the Cashier and the Chef without needing a manual Manager role.

## 🔐 1. Authentication & Security Engine
*Status: Active / Core Implemented*

A secure, stateless session authentication system built with Spring Security and OAuth2 Resource Server.

> [!WARNING]
> **Testing Mode:** Token durations (such as the 2-minute refresh token expiry) are currently extendable and kept short for the purpose of testing.

* **Stateless JWT Access Tokens:** 2-minute (configurable to 15-minute) JSON Web Tokens carrying client claims (`userId`, `role`) for fast authorization.
* **Stateful Refresh Tokens:** Cryptographically secure UUID tokens stored in the database to manage active sessions.
* **Early Refresh Protection:** Prevents client/frontend bugs from spamming token refreshes by enforcing a 30-second cooldown timer.
* **Automatic Expiration Cleanup:** Automatically cleans up expired sessions on subsequent token generation.
* **Custom JSON Error Filters:** Custom `AuthenticationEntryPoint` intercepting all Spring Security failures to return clean, structured JSON errors to the client instead of HTML error pages.

## 📦 2. Database & Entity Model
*Status: Active / Core Implemented*

A relational schema modeled in PostgreSQL using Hibernate/JPA, optimized for historical sales auditing and data integrity.

* **Single-Device Enforcement:** Bi-directional `@OneToOne` mapping between `UserEntity` and `TokenEntity` restricts each account to a single active session.
* **Price Snapshot Auditing:** `OrderItemEntity` stores a price snapshot (`unitPrice`) at the exact time of purchase to protect historical sales reports if menu prices change.
* **Automatic JPA Auditing:** `MenuEntity` and `OrderEntity` utilize `@EnableJpaAuditing` to automatically track creation and update timestamps without manual database writes.
* **Cascading Protections:** Cascading is restricted to parent-to-child paths (e.g. deleting an Order deletes its items) while preventing child-to-parent deletion (deleting an Order/Item never deletes a User or Menu Item).

## 💵 3. Cashier Flow (POS API)
*Status: Planned / Next Phase*

Endpoints mapped to `/api/cashier/**` allowing cashiers to handle customer checkouts.

* **Submit Customer Order:** Creates a new `OrderEntity` with multiple `OrderItemEntity` items, fetching current prices from the menu and capturing snapshots.
* **Calculate Order Total:** Automatically sums the snapshot prices of all items.
* **View Active Tickets:** Allows cashiers to track the status of placed orders.

## 🍳 4. Chef Flow (KDS API)
*Status: Planned / Next Phase*

Endpoints mapped to `/api/chef/**` enabling kitchen display terminals to display real-time cooking tickets.

* **FIFO Pending Queue:** Displays all waiting orders sorted strictly by their arrival time, ensuring the oldest orders are always visible at the front.
* **Chef-Managed Active Batching:** Allows the Chef to select and accept a subset of orders they have capacity to cook at once, changing their status from `waiting` to `cooking`.
* **Smart Consolidated Prep Helper:** For the accepted orders in the active `cooking` state, the system automatically aggregates duplicate menu items (e.g. displaying *"3x Burgers"* total across Order #1 and Order #2). This simplifies chef multitasking without relying on unpredictable AI scheduling.
* **Menu Availability Toggle:** Enables the chef to flag menu items as sold-out (`isAvailable = false`), instantly syncing with the Cashier interface to prevent ordering unavailable items.

## ⚙️ 5. Admin Panel API
*Status: Not Planned Yet (Future Backlog)*

Management endpoints mapped to `/api/admin/**` for restaurant owners/administrators.

* **Pre-seeded Account Provisioning:** Manage account credentials for cashiers and chefs (registration is disabled to secure terminal logins).
* **Menu Editor:** Add new dishes, change active pricing, and edit category headers.
